# balls

An attempt to make a casual game with mechanics similar to Luxor / Zuma / Puzz Loop. Includes a simple path editor based on Bézier curves. The gameplay itself isn't yet implemented though.

## How to "play"

The first thing you'll see after running this piece of software is the path editor. You can use the left mouse button to add new nodes, to move them around and to adjust their handles. Right-click a node to remove it. Hold shift while adjusting a node handle to make a cusp. Also, curve colors are selected randomly and don't mean anything, just so you know.

Press space to switch to the "game mode". Here you can shoot balls from your cannon with the left mouse button and swap the current/next balls with the right mouse button. That's all for now, have fun, I guess.
